# Using Natural Language Processing to Analyse Customers Reviews
This project uses the same methods with what I have used in Wells Fargo's internship program. Because of the sensitive data and confidentiality, I am not allowed to show the original dataset I used for my internship program. Therefore, I replaced the original dataset with the public dataset of the reviews from Amazon customers and did the same analysis on their reviews using NLP, just to give people a general idea on how this program is about. 
The database used is labeled customers' reviews (in English) from Amazon. By tokenization, removing stop words and punctuations, stemming, lemmatization, human language is separated into fragments, words are transformed into numbers. After cleaning the data, several machine learning methods including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost were applied to predict if the customers' reviews are negative or positive. In order to test if the model is good (how well the model predicts), training set and testing set were splited before the models were applied. In the end, some data visualizations like wordcloud, topic modeling were applied for better understanding of the data.
