# Using Natural Language Processing to Analyse Customers Reviews
The database used is labeled customers' reviews (in English) from Amazon.  By tokenization, removing stop words and punctuations, stemming, lemmatization, human language is separated into fragments, words are transformed into numbers. After cleaning the data, several machine learning methods including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost were applied to predict if the customers' reviews are negative or positive. In order to test if the model is good (how well the model predicts), training set and testing set were splited before the models were applied. In the end, data visualizations like wordcloud, topic modeling were applied for better understanding of the data.
